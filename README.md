# NREGA Analysis Project
This project analyzes NREGA's effectiveness in providing rural employment using Power BI, highlighting regional disparities and budget utilization. It also includes SQL analysis of COVID-19 data.

## Introduction
This project delves into the analysis of data related to the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA), a transformative government scheme aimed at providing rural households with guaranteed wage employment opportunities.

## Problem Statement
This project addresses the following questions:
- How effective is NREGA in providing employment opportunities to rural households?
- Are there regional disparities in the implementation and outcomes of the scheme?
- What is the utilization of the allocated budget, and how does it correlate with employment generation?
- What are the key factors contributing to the completion of NREGA works, and are there any roadblocks to its success?
- Can data-driven insights guide policymakers and administrators in optimizing the scheme's impact?

## Dataset Information
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from official government records and contains information related to NREGA implementation across various states and districts in India. It comprises 28 columns, encompassing data on job cards, worker details, budget allocation, work completion statistics, expenditure, and more.

## Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing and Cleaning: Ensured data quality.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns, trends, and disparities.
3. Data Visualization: Presented key findings effectively.
4. Insights and Recommendations: Provided actionable insights to inform policymakers and administrators.

## Dashboards
The project includes four dashboards created in Power BI:
- Dashboard 1: Employment and Budget Overview
  
- Dashboard 2: Detailed Employment Analysis

- Dashboard 3: Financial and Work Status Analysis
  
- Dashboard 4: Regional Analysis
  


## Future Work
Future analysis could explore:
- Seasonal impacts on employment.
- More granular village-level data for deeper insights.
- Continued monitoring to optimize NREGAâ€™s impact.
